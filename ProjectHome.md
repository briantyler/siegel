C++ application and template library for computing Siegel Sets in SU(n,1,O) where O is the ring of integers of an imaginary quadratic field.

Requires:
**Boost 1.34 or greater.** 64-bit architecture.
**GNU 4.1 C++ compiler or greater.** GMP is optional.

Probably only runs under Linux.

Amongst other things it contains some classes for imaginary quadratic fields, rings of integers and ideals.
