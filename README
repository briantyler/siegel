SIEGEL / SIEGELCL - The fun Siegel set generator program for the whole family
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   to enjoy!

SIEGEL generates Siegel sets for the action of SU(n,1;O) on HCn where O
is the ring of integers of an imaginary quadratic field with trivial class
group. Its little brother SIEGELCL counts the cusps in the Siegel sets
generated by SIEGEL.

See ./INSTALL for installation instructions.

WARNING: This program does not run on 32-bit operating systems. It might
compile, but it will crash immediately. I am fully aware of this; the numbers
it deals with are far too big to mess around with 32-bit architecture.

The super short installation guide:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Checklist:
 * 64-bit OS.
 * GCC 4.1+.
 * Boost 1.34.1+ (http://www.boost.org/). Only the header libraries are needed,
   so you just need to download them and stick them somewhere.
 * (optional - and in fact totally unnecessary) GMP multiprecision library
   with C++ support (http://gmplib.org/).

At the command prompt type:
  $ ./configure
  $ make

Then as root type
  # make install

if you know what your GCC architecture optimisation flag is then change
  $ ./configure

to
  $ ./configure --with-gcc-arch=<arch>

where <arch> is your architecture. This sets the -march flag on the compiler;
on a standard Intel 64-bit machine "nocona" will always work, if you have GCC
4.3+ and a Core2 Duo (or better) then use core2. Try doing a search online for
"GCC <your version of GCC> Intel 386 and AMD x86-64 Options" unless you are
using some exotic architecture, in which case I would be very surprised if the
program even contemplated compiling, much less running; let me know if it does.
 If you want to run this program for more than just curiosity then you need to
know what this flag is.

If you don't have root permissions, or you have a strange set up on your machine
, or like to mess with things that really don't concern you, then type:
  $ ./configure --help

to get more information on how to tell the configure script where to install
the application and where to find the Boost libraries on your machine.

The super short user guide:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After installing type:
  $ siegel --help
  $ siegelcl --help

at the command prompt for more information.

Any bugs you find can be sent to brian.tyler@gmail.com. If you can fix the bug
first so much the better! If you are a researcher who is interested in my work
then please feel free to email at the same address me for moral and possibly
technical support; /** it would be a pleasure to help you **/

If you want to contact someone in the mathematical community about this
thesis / project, then please contact Dr. Andrei Yafaev (currently at UCL).

I now work as a professional software engineer.
